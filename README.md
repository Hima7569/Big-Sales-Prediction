The provided code snippet outlines the process of loading a dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing the data, and applying a machine learning model to predict sales. 
Initially, the dataset is imported using pandas and basic information about it is displayed. 
Data visualization techniques such as pair plots and scatter plots are used to understand relationships between variables. 
Categorical data is encoded using one-hot encoding, and numerical features are standardized using StandardScaler. 
The data is then split into training and testing sets. A RandomForestRegressor model is trained on the training set and predictions are made on the test set.
The model's performance is evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE). T
he scatter plot of actual vs. predicted sales visually represents the model's accuracy. 
The steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation, demonstrating a complete data science workflow.
